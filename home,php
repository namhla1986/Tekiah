		<h2><strong>Building a better community</strong></h2>
        <br>
    <article class="paragraph">    
<p><strong>Tekiah Foundation</strong>&nbsp;is a registered non profit organisation who has launched an exciting initiative in the Steenberg/Retreat/Lavender Hill areas called the&nbsp;<strong>Tekiah Foundation Sports Program</strong>.</p>
<br>
<p>Tekiah Foundation approached primary schools &ndash; all previously disadvantaged and has launched a Life Skills Program, using sport as a tool.</p>
<p>Having started with soccer, we have taken over the coaching and managerial responsibilities of three soccer teams (u/11, u/13 boys and u/14 girls) at each school &ndash; a total of 12 teams or 180 kids.</p><p>Through this programme&nbsp;<strong>Tekiah Foundation</strong>&nbsp;plans to revive school sport in the Steenberg/Retreat/Lavender Hill areas by introducing different sports codes to the program and include more learners over the next 3 to 5 years.hh</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Tekiah Foundation</strong>&nbsp;is of the opinion that sport and recreation play an important part in young people&rsquo;s lives and that it helps shape community identity. We believe that sport and recreation improves social cohesion and that it provides opportunities for social interaction and sharing of common interests, thus&nbsp;fostering community spirit.</p><p style="margin-left:36pt">&nbsp;</p>
